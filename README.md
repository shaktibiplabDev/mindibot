MindiBot is more than just a bot; it's an experiment in creating a true AI companion for Minecraft. It's built to be extensible and community-driven, with deep integration into Discord for communication and control. Our goal is to create an AI that can learn from players, take on complex tasks, and become a genuine member of the server community.

### ‚ú® Features

*   **üß† Advanced AI Brain:** A central logic unit that manages tasks, goals, and dynamic decision-making.
*   **üí¨ Natural Language Chat:** Integrates with the Gemini API to understand and respond to players in natural, human-like conversation.
*   **ü§ñ Modular Architecture:** Built with a clear separation of concerns (Body, Brain, Communication), making it easy for new developers to understand and contribute.
*   **üéÆ Discord Control Center:** A dedicated Discord bot allows the community to see the bot's status, give it commands, and influence its goals.
*   **üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Sandbox Ready:** Designed with a "Developer Plan" in mind, where contributors can have their own bots join the server to test new features.

---

### üöÄ How It Works

The project follows a simple but powerful architecture:

*   **The Body (`Bot.js`):** This is the Mineflayer instance. Its only job is to connect to the Minecraft server, execute low-level actions (move, dig, chat), and report world events (seeing chat, taking damage).
*   **The Brain (`Brain.js`):** This is the central decision-making unit. It receives information from the Body and Discord, maintains the bot's current state and goals, and decides what action to take next.
*   **The Mouth & Ears (`Discord.js` & `LLM.js`):** These modules handle all communication. `Discord.js` connects to the Discord server to listen for commands and post updates. `LLM.js` connects to the Gemini API to generate intelligent chat responses.
